## Quick start a new project

You can create and augment your own projects in Rill Developer using the [CLI](/cli). Every project starts by initializing the experience. Once initialized, you can ingest data into the project and start the UI.

```
rill init
rill import-source /path/to/data_1.parquet
rill start
```

or try our example:

```
rill init-example
```

<!-- (Please note that the command `rill init-example` is temporarily unavailable on Windows.) -->
